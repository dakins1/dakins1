- 👋 Hi, I’m @dakins1
- 👀 I’m interested in functional programming with Scala, and sometimes I dabble in embedded systems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning.......you guessed it, functional programming with Scala, and embedded systems
  - Recenlty started reading *Functional Programming in Scala* by Paul Chiusano and Rúnar Bjarnason
  - Working through Muro Samek's Quantum Leaps youtube series on embedded programming with the TI Tiva-C Launchpad ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller
- ⚒ Current projects:
  - Scala chat generator
      - Implements Markov Chain/n-gram trained off a collection of group chat messages. 
      - Generates random text designed to sound like something you or someone from your group chat would say. 
      - Important thing here is it is built with functional style Scala.
